Language Barrier Project
Overview
The Language Barrier Project is a simple demonstration of the Adapter Pattern in Java, using a language barrier analogy. The project features two friends who speak different languages (English and French) and an adapter that facilitates communication between them. The Adapter Pattern is applied to showcase how disparate interfaces can be adapted to work seamlessly together.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

Speaker Interface: Defines a common set of methods for speaking, introducing, getting the language, and converting currency.

EnglishSpeaker Class: Implements the Speaker Interface for an English-speaking friend.

FrenchSpeaker Class: Implements the Speaker Interface for a French-speaking friend.

LanguageAdapter Class: Acts as an adapter, translating messages and handling currency conversion.

Main Class: Contains the main method for user interaction and demonstration of the project.
